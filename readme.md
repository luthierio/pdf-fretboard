### Fretboard

A small utility written in Python to generate a printable version of a fretboard for any given scale length.

It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

```python
. venv/bin/activate
virtualenv venv
```
Then, install the required libraries and run.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```
python freatboard.py [<scale_length> <num_frets>]
```
